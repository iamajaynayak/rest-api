# rest-api
Rest-api for users, using Express, Mongoose and mongodb


# this is first project for backend
I build this for learning purpose, you can also use it with "POSTMAN" to test 

1. GET request -> To get users off of the database

2. GET request to query -> To find a specific user by passing their '__id_' to param

3. POST request -> To add a new user/ user data to the database

4. PUT request -> You can also pass a param to get a user, and update their information

5. DELETE request -> To delete a user from the database
